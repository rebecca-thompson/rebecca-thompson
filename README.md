# Hey there, I'm Becca! ğŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer at The Guardian. In a previous life, I worked as a marketing manager in the adventure travel industry before retraining to achieve a Bsc. in Creative Computing and starting a new career in tech. The travel perks arenâ€™t quite what they used to be, but otherwise Iâ€™m loving it!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: mostly Scala, React and Typescript applications
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: to be a better frontend developer. Yikes! So many browsers ğŸ˜µ
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: improving diversity in tech. Technology is ubiquitous in our lives and it is vital it is created by as diverse a group as those who use it
